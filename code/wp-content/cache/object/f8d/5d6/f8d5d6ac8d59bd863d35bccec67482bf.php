                                    Securities regulation is primarily conducted at the provincial and territorial level. Each province and territory has its own securities commission or regulatory authority responsible for enforcing securities laws, rules, and regulations. Notable regulators include the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC), and the Autorit√© des march√©s financiers (AMF) in Quebec.

                                    Issuers of securities, such as stocks, bonds, or investment funds, are generally required to prepare and file a prospectus with the applicable securities regulator before offering securities to the public. The prospectus provides detailed information about the issuer, the securities being offered, and the associated risks, ensuring investors have access to relevant information for making informed investment decisions.

                                    Certain exemptions from the prospectus requirements exist, allowing issuers to raise capital without preparing a full prospectus. These exemptions are often based on the investor's status, investment amount, or specific offering criteria. Offering memorandums may also be used for certain exempt offerings to provide disclosure to investors.

                                    Publicly traded companies in Canada are subject to ongoing disclosure requirements, which include timely filing of financial statements, management's discussion and analysis (MD&A), and material change reports.
